The simulation is stochastic, so larger samples will be more accurate, but require longer to run. This does not account for the lower risk due to screening out comorbidities, or any risks that differ between intentional exposure trials and natural exposure. It also assumes no rescue therapy is applied, and does not include the greater clinical success of current COVID-19 treatment compared to the treatment available between March and the beginning of May, the time period covered by the Salje et al. data."),

The size of such a trial may vary, but one approach would be to expose 5 volunteers each to 3 increasing titers of COVID-19, stopping if the majority or all volunteers for a given exposure level develop clinical disease. Following this, an additional 10-20 volunteers would be given the appropriate titer of COVID-19, to validate the initial result."),
